    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The infographic is structured as a single, scrollable page with distinct sections. It now starts with a prominent 'Latest News' section (updated with detailed news article), followed by 'JotForm Agent' section, 'Book an Appointment', 'Get Directions', then the Executive Summary and Hospital Overview (updated with founding year and private hospital status), Services Offered, Key Medical Professionals (Dr. A L Sinha), Patient Feedback, Operational Aspects, Quality Standards & Accreditations, Insurance & Payment (updated with digital payment options), Community Engagement.
    A new 'Contact Information' section has been added with the corrected website link.
    The 'Hospital Gallery & Virtual Tour' section remains distinct with its image and external Google Maps link.
    The interactive Google Maps iframe section is retained.
    Individual sections for each review and social media platform (including all new YouTube links, JotForm feedback forms, Tumblr, Viber, Roposo, StarMaker, Clubhouse, Channelcom Tech, Koo, LinkedIn, Patreon, Moj, Line, Wattpad, and Blogspot links) follow, and finally Key Recommendations. The link to the Gujarati version of the page has been removed. This narrative flow is designed to guide the user logically through the hospital's profile, from general information to specific details and actionable advice, making complex report data easily understandable in an infographic format. -->

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold primary-blue-text mb-3">Doctors Anoop Lal Sinha: 10.5 kg ovarian cyst removed</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Date: Mar 11, 2006 03:25 AM IST</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">In a rare incident of its kind, an ovarian cyst measuring 30 cm x 13 cm and weighing 10.5 kg was successfully removed from a 47-year-old woman's body at the Railway Hospital in Rajkot on Friday.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">"The operation, which lasted 90 minutes, was performed by Dr. Anoop Lal Sinha, a general surgeon. After the surgery, the patient was feeling quite "hale and hearty."</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">"This was a unique case in that despite carrying such a heavy tumor inside her for a pretty long time, the patient was not feeling any pain. She herself told me that she was feeling perfectly alright," said Dr. Sinha.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">When the patient was brought to the hospital on March 6, the doctors initially believed that it was a case of pregnancy. However, when she denied it, they became concerned and curious.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">"Normally, the patient begins to feel acute pain when the size of the ovarian cyst begins to increase rapidly and the weight starts crossing the usual limit of about 6 kg or so. This was a truly remarkable, even challenging, case because not only had her tumor surpassed the normal size and weight, but she was also feeling no pain," explained Dr. Sinha.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Dr. Anoop Lal Sinha now runs his own private hospital named Vishal Hospital in Rajkot, Gujarat. The hospital is located on Kailashwadi Main Road, Opposite Taluka Polish Choki, Junction Plot, Rajkot, Gujarat 360001. You can contact him at mobile number 9228105245 or landline number 0281-2450408.</p>

            You are an AI website manager assistant for the Vishal Hospital website.
            Your primary role is to help users *add new content or features* to the website by providing code.
            You can also help *suggest code-based solutions* for problems if the user describes them.
            You *cannot* directly monitor, diagnose, or autonomously fix live website issues. Your function is purely additive and advisory, providing code snippets for the user to implement.
            You *cannot* remove or delete any existing content or features.
            When a user asks to add something, ask them to describe what they want to add in detail, and then provide the relevant code.
            Explain that the user will need to manually copy and paste the code into their website file.
            Example additions you can help with:
            - A new text section
            - A new image placeholder
            - A new button linking to an external site
            - A simple interactive element (e.g., a counter, a simple form)
            - A new social media link
            - A new section for patient testimonials.
            - A new paragraph of text.
            - A new heading.
            - A new list.
            - A new link.
            - A new video embed (provide example YouTube embed code).
            - A new contact form (provide simple HTML structure).
            - A new section with a background color.
            - A new icon (provide Font Awesome example).
            Example problem-solving suggestions:
            - If a user says "My button isn't centered," you can provide CSS to center it.
            - If a user says "I want to add a new image but it's too big," you can provide CSS to resize it.
            - If a user says "My text is too small," you can provide CSS to increase font size.
